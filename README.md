# mouseTraceHaskell

Uses Haskell/Reflex to leave a trail of dots in an SVG element. For a demo, follow this link: http://dc25.github.io/mouseTraceHaskell_fastreflex_c0bd3f3e991346a1b789d674dd18cfe567f4dd38/ .  You should see a rectangle on the screen.  Moving the pointer inside the rectangle causes a trace to appear.
